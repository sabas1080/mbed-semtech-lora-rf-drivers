# Mbed enabled Semtech LoRa/FSK radio drivers. 

## NOTE! This fork is EXPERIMENTAL created for [Arduino Core Mbed](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed). 

From mbed-os 6.0 onwards, these drivers are included in mbed-os as components. To enable your driver just enable the driver in mbed_app.json as e.g `"target.components_add": ["SX126X"],`
